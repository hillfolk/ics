This is the first ICS beta version that runs on MacOS and FireMonkey.
Not all units have been ported yet and currently MacOS support
has been tested in Delphi only.

Folder \Delphi\PlatformDemos contains some FireMonkey and
cross platform console applications, they have been ported
from their original windows versions.

It is very important that you add conditional define "FMX" to
any FireMonkey application's project options for _all platforms
otherwise most of the ICS components won't compile.

Currently ICS components can only be dropped on a FireMonkey form
if one of the Windows platform targets is active in project manager,
when OSX target is active ICS components on the Tool Palette are
greyed out. 

Enjoy
