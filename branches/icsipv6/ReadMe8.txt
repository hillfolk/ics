Contributions:
--------------

ICS has been designed by François PIETTE but many other peoples are working on the
components and sample programs. The history of changes in each source file list
all developers having contributed (When no name is given, the change is by F. Piette).
I can't list all contributors here but I want to specially thanks two specially active
contributors:
    - Arno Garrels <arno.garrels@gmx.de>
    - Angus Robertson <angus@magsys.co.uk>


Installation:
-------------

ICS Beta V8 has been designed for Delphi 2009 and up, and BCB 2009 and up, but
is fully compatible with Delphi 7, 2006 and 2007.

With Delphi XE2 and later, VCL 64-bit Windows targets are supported for Delphi only.
Currently FireMonkey is partly supported for Delphi only (there are still a few non-ported
components). Ics for Mac OSX is currently experimental.

The zip file has subdirectories in it. You must use the WinZip "Use folder
names" option to restore this directory tree or you will have problems
because the files would not be in their proper subdirectories.

This is the subdirectory layout:

.\                                    Info directory
.\Install                             Component packages project groups for all versions

UPGRADING and REINSTALLING
Uninstall an existing ICS package (Menu | Component | Install Packages, select
the component package and click Remove).
Rename the old ICS directory and unzip to a new or empty directory, remove the
old path from the library path and add either the new .\Source directory to the library
path under Tools | Options |... or the appropriate Lib subdirectory.
The latter has the advantage that the ICS source code won't be recompiled whenever
your project is build. Also under Tools | Options |... add the new .\Source directory
to the Browsing path.

All DELPHI and C++ BUILDER VERSIONS/WIN32
Always upgrade your compiler with the latest update available from Borland.
Always update your system with http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com

SSL or not SSL?
By default the SSL code is compiled into the run-time package and additional SSL-
enabled components are installed. In order to not compile the SSL code into the
run-time package and to not install the SSL-Enabled components you need to remove
the conditional define USE_SSL from both the run-time and design-time package.
However if you do not build your applications with run-time packages it is
recommended to build the packages with default settings. The SSL code will the
be compiled into your applications depending on whether the conditional define
USE_SSL is set in the project options or not (this requires having the .\Source
directory in either in the library path or in projects Search path).
Actual use of SSL in your applications also requires LIBEAY32.DLL and SSLEAY32.DLL
being available somewhere in the path, more details in IcsSslHowTo.txt.

INSTALLATION USING THE INSTALL PROJECT GROUPS
For each Delphi and C++ Builder version one project group is provided in directory
.\Install:

Delphi 7         :  D7Install.bpg
Delphi 2006      :  D2006Install.bdsgroup
Delphi 2007      :  D2007Install.groupproj
Delphi 2009      :  D2009Install.groupproj
Delphi 2010      :  D2010Install.groupproj
Delphi XE        :  DXeInstall.groupproj
Delphi XE2       :  DXe2Install.groupproj // VCL only, no FireMonkey components
Delphi XE2       :  DXe2InstallVclFmx.groupproj // Both VCL and FireMonkey components
C++ Builder 2006 :  CB2006Install.bdsgroup
C++ Builder 2007 :  CB2007Install.groupproj
C++ Builder 2009 :  CB2009Install.groupproj
C++ Builder 2010 :  CB2010Install.groupproj
C++ Builder XE   :  CBXeInstall.groupproj
C++ Builder XE2  :  CBXe2Install.groupproj // VCL only no FireMonkey components


1 - Do a File/Open Project, navigate to the Install directory, select the correct
file and open it. The project manager view should now display two package
projects, one run-time and one design-time package. The run-time package name
contains the "Run" suffix. The design-time package name contains the "Design"
suffix.
2 - Select and Build the run-time package (do not install).
3 - Select and Install the design-time package.

After a few seconds, you should have a dialog box telling you the package has
been installed with a bunch of new components registered in the Tool Palette
under "Overbyte ICS" and "Overbyte ICS SSL". Then do a "Save All" and a "Close All".

ALTERNATE INSTALLATION USING THE PACKAGE PROJECT FILES:
For each Delphi and C++ Builder version two package project files exist in the
VC32 directory. One run-time and one design-time package project file.
The run-time file name contains the "Run" suffix. The design-time file name
contains the "Design" suffix.

PACKAGE PROJECT FILE NAMES:
Delphi 7         :  OverbyteIcsD7Run.dpk, OverbyteIcsD7Design.dpk
Delphi 2006      :  OverbyteIcsD2006Run.bdsproj, OverbyteIcsD2006Design.bdsproj
Delphi 2007      :  OverbyteIcsD2007Run.dproj, OverbyteIcsD2007Design.dproj
Delphi 2009      :  OverbyteIcsD2009Run.dproj, OverbyteIcsD2009Design.dproj
Delphi 2010      :  OverbyteIcsD2010Run.dproj, OverbyteIcsD2010Design.dproj
Delphi XE        :  OverbyteIcsDXeRun.dproj, OverbyteIcsDXeDesign.dproj
Delphi XE2       :  OverbyteIcsDXe2Run.dproj, OverbyteIcsDXe2Design.dproj
C++ Builder 2006 :  OverbyteIcsCB2006Run.bdsproj, OverbyteIcsCB2006Design.bdsproj
C++ Builder 2007 :  OverbyteIcsCB2007Run.cbproj, OverbyteIcsCB2007Design.cbproj
C++ Builder 2009 :  OverbyteIcsCB2009Run.cbproj, OverbyteIcsCB2009Design.cbproj
C++ Builder 2010 :  OverbyteIcsCB2010Run.cbproj, OverbyteIcsCB2010Design.cbproj
C++ Builder XE   :  OverbyteIcsCBXeRun.cbproj, OverbyteIcsCBXeDesign.cbproj
C++ Builder XE2  :  OverbyteIcsCBXe2Run.cbproj, OverbyteIcsCBXe2Design.cbproj

1 - Open and Build the run-time package project (do not install!).
2 - Open and Install the design-time package project.
(Do a File/Open Project, browse to the VC32 directory. Select the correct file
and open it. Then in the project manager view, right-click on the package,
then click on either the Build or Install button.)
3 - For Delphi XE2, a 64-bit run-time package can be built by changing the
package target platform to 64-bit Windows. This has the same name as the 32-bit
package, so a different package output directory needs to be specified in
Tools / Options / Delphi Options for 64-bit Windows.

After a few seconds, you should have a dialog box telling you the package has
been installed with a bunch of new components registered in the Tool Palette
under "Overbyte ICS" and "Overbyte ICS SSL". Then do a "Save All" and a "Close All".

DELPHI 2006/WIN32, 2007/WIN32, 2009/WIN32, 2010/WIN32, XE/WIN32:
Having installed the package, verify that the VC32 directory has been added to
the Win32 Library Path (Tools / Options / Delphi Options / Library - Win32 /
Library Path). If not, add it manually. It is not mandatory to add vc32 to the global
Delphi path, but it will be much easier for you because otherwise you'll have to
add it to each project.

DELPHI XE2/WIN32 and XE2/WIN64: Similar to above, but the Library path is specified
separately for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows Platforms.

DELPHI 7: Add VC32 directory path to your library path (Tools menu / Environment
Options / Library / Library Path. Add VC32 path at the end of the existing path).

Once the package is installed, you may open the sample projects. There is a single
project group called OverByteIcsDemo.bpg for all versions (7, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010,
XE and XE2) which has all sample programs. Open it with file/open project (Ctrl-F11),
browse to the Internet directory, select and open OverByteIcsDemo.bpg. You might get
some dialog box telling you that resource files are missing (they have not been
included in the zip file to save space) and are recreated by Delphi. It is OK.
Any other error message is a problem you should fix. After all resource files have
been recreated, you should see in the project manager a group of projects called
OverByteIcsDemo. In this group, you'll find all sample programs.

To compile all samples at once, do Project / Build all projects. This will
take some time to compile all sample programs. Delphi may run out of
memory if you don't have enough RAM installed in your computer.
If this happended, just build the projects one by one.

Note 1: Delphi may run out of memory if you ask to compile all projects at
once. If you have not enough RAM, then compile each project individually.

Note 2: Delphi has warnings which triggers a lot of messages for 100% OK
code. You can turn those warnings off in the project/ options / Compiler messages
and deselecting: "Deprecated symbol", "Platform symbol", "unsafe type", "unsafe code",
"unsafe typecast". Those are intended for .NET and Linux portability. You can
safely ignore them if you run windows. For you facility, I included a utility
SetProjectOptions (source code, you must compile it) in the internet directory.
This utility will update project options to disable the warnings.

Once the components are all installed, you may open the sample projects
each one after the other and compile them. For each project, do file/open
and select the dpr file in the internet directory. Then Project/Build All.

CBUILDER 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, XE, XE2:
Follow the installation procedure described for Delphi 2006. Just change
the project group and package name: replace "del" by "bcb" in their names.
You can't have Delphi 2006 and CBuilder 2006 packages installed at the
same time in the IDE. So when switching from one to the other, be sure to
remove the one you don't need.
If you need both BCB and Delphi personalities ate the same time, then
use Delphi 2006 package (OverbyteIcsDel100.bpl) and change his options to make it
a dual mode Delphi/CPP package. See Borland documentation.

Once the components are all installed, you may open the sample projects
each one after the other and compile them. For each project, do file/open
and select the dpr file in the internet directory. Then Project/Build All.
Projects are located in CPP/INTERNET/BCB6. There is also a project group
OverbyteBcb60Sam.bpg which contains all sample projects.
It is likely that for each project, Bcb complains about a missing .res
file. This is not a problem, Bcb will recreate it as needed. They have not
been included to save space in the zip file.

Once the components are all installed, you may open the sample projects
each one after the other and compile them. For each project, do file/open
and select the dpr file in the internet directory. Then Project/Build All.
Projects are located in CPP/INTERNET/BCB1.


NOTES:
- You may have an error message, using Delphi or BCB, complaining about
Font.Charset, OldCreateOrder and other properties. Those are new properties
in newer Delphi or BCB versions, newer than the version you use.
You can safely ignore those errors because those properties are not
used by the components nor sample programs. You may encounter this
error at run time. To avoid it, you must open each form at design time
and ignore the error. Then recompile. If you don't ignore the error
at design time, you'll have it at runtime !

- If you have Delphi or BCB complaining about a file not found, add VC32
directory to your library path.

- If you are using BCB you may encounter an error at link time
such as "Unable to open file MWBCB30.LIB" (or other libs). This is a bug
in BCB. To solve it, you can edit project option file (right click in
project manager) and remove any reference to the missing libraries.

- Don't forget that the C++Builder components are located in .\delphi\vc32
which is object pascal source code (not a problem for C++Builder, just
indicate that the *.pas files are displayed when installing). C++Builder
will create the *.hpp files. There are some on-line help files in the VC32
directory.

Note 1: Many samples are similar. When searching for something, always look at the date
        the demos where created. The most recent is always the best code !
Note 2: Not all samples have been rewritten in C++ for BCB. And those rewritten are
        frequently much simpler. So BCB user: have a look at the Delphi sample too !
Note 3: Follow "UserMade" link on ICS website to find more sample programs written by
        ICS users.
Note 4: See folder SslInternet for SSL-enabled versions of the samples.

As explained in the component installation, you may encounter an error loading
a sample application or running it. This may be because the last time I
loaded the form, I was using another Delphi or BCB version which has new properties.
You can safely ignore messages related to those new properties. They are not used
in the samples. (The properties are CharSet, OldCreateOrder and others).
You can also encounter error about duplicate resources. You can ignore them
safely. If you have those errors, open each form in the IDE, ignore the error
then recompile. If you don't open the form in the IDE, you'll get the errors
at runtime and your program will abort.

When installing a new version, always delete old dcu, obj, dcpil and always
recompile everything !
Close everything before recompiling the library or packages.
When installing a new version, be sure to unzip it in the same directory
tree as the old one or you'll mess both versions.

It is possible to use several Delphi or BCB versions at the same time, but
before switching from one to the other, you MUST delete all DCU, OBJ, ILS,
ILF, TDS, ILC and ILD files.For BCB, you sometimes need to delete HPP files
as well. They will be recreated when you reinstall ICS components.

About SSL:
----------
TSslWSocket and TSslWSocketServer component are derived from the standard
TWSocket and TWSocketServer component. The SSL code is compiled into the
component only if you define USE_SSL symbol to your packages and projects.
Just add USE_SSL to the defines in the project or package options and
recompile everything.

The components make use of LIBEAY32.DLL and SSLEAY32.DLL to handle SSL
protocol stuff. The DLLs are dynamically loaded at runtime. It means that
the DLLs will only be required at runtime when you first make use of a SSL
function. Your applications will run on systems without OpenSSL DLLs as long
as you don't call any SSL function.

This version requires OpenSsl version 0.98e! If you need to support
older OpenSsl versions as well (not recommended) define symbol
BEFORE_OSSL_098E in OverbyteIcsSslDefs.inc and rebuild all.

Most ICS components have their SSL enabled counter part. They work exactly
the same way as the regular component except when SSL specific stuff is needed,
for example certificates. To support SSL stuff, the SSL-enabled version use
some new properties, events and methods. Many sample programs have their
SSL-enabled counter part in a separate sources located in SslInternet folder.

SSL certificates:
To make use of SSL, you frequently need certificates. I provide some demo
certificates I built using command line OpenSSL tool. PEM certificates can
be opened by a text editor, LF as well as CRLF are allowed as line breaks.

CACERT.PEM :   A demo certificate for "Example CA"
01CERT.PEM :   A demo certificate which is signed by CACERT.PEM
01KEY.PEM :    A demo private key for 01CERT.PEM
               Passphrase is "password".
CLIENT.PEM :   A demo certificate and private key.
               Passphrase is "password".
SERVER.PEM :   A demo certificate and private key.
               Passphrase is "password".
ROOT.PEM :     A demo CA certificate.
               Passphrase is "password".
TRUSTEDCABUNDLE.PEM :
               A demo CA file in PEM format containing multiple
               well known root CA certificates to be specified in
               property CA Path of the demo applications. Read
               the comments included in this file.
6F6359FC.0 :   Located in sub directory SslInternet\TrustedCaStore,
               it's the file CACERT.PEM stored with a hashed file
               name. Directory TrustedCaStore can be spezified in
               property CA Path of the demo applications.

For details about certificate, see the excellent book:
  "Network security with OpenSSL", O'Reilly, ISBN 10: 0-596-00270-X

You will find more information in IcsSslHowTo.txt file.


Support:
--------
There is a mailing list to discuss F. Piette's components and applications.
To subscribe surf to http://lists.elists.org/mailman/listinfo/twsocket.
Do not use an aliased EMail address, use your real EMail address, the one
you'll use to post messages. After asking for subscription, you'll receive a
confirmation email you must reply to it or you will _not_ be added to the
subscriber's list (this is to check for email path and also make sure
someone doesn't subscribe you without your consent).

Once you have been registered with the mailing list processor, you can
send messages to twsocket@elists.org. Every subscriber will receive a copy of
your message. I will respond, but anybody is welcome to respond to each
other's messages. So every body can share his expertise. There are many other
useful mailing lists at http://www.elists.org !

Before asking a question, browse the message archive you can download from
the support page on the website (click the "support" button from main page)
and from the mailing list website http://lists.elists.org/mailman/listinfo/twsocket.
Google is also archiving the list with some delay.

If you found a bug, please make a short program that reproduces the problem
attach it to a message addressed to me. If I can reproduce the problem, I
can find a fix ! Do not send exe file but just source code and instructions.
Always use the latest version (beta if any) before reporting any bug.

You are also encouraged to use the support mailing list to ask for
enhancements. You are welcome to post your own code.

The support mailing list has sometimes a heavy traffic. If
it is too much for you, you can select "digest" mode in which mailing list
processor will mail you only one big message per day. To select digest mode
goto http://lists.elists.org/mailman/listinfo/twsocket.

You can also subscribe to another mailing list called twsocket-announce which
will receive only very few messages when major bug fixes or updates are done.
The subscription process is the same as for the other mailing list.
See above procedure.


Release notes
-------------

There is no global release notes. Each component and sample has his own history.
You can find those histories in the comment in the beginning of each source file.
There are also a bunch of useful comments in the source code. You should at least
browse the source for the components you are interested in.


MidWare
-------
If you wants to build client/server applications using TCP/IP protocol, you
can do it easily with ICS. But you can do it much more easily using another
freeware product from François Piette: MidWare. Available from the same web
site http://www.overbyte.be.
